# Collecting Benchmark Functions Metadata

I'm collecting metadata on Benchmark functions used in Computational Intelligence.

My goal is to create a python database of all of these functions along with 
their readible data - such as latex functions, names etc. as well as their
usable data - such as the physical input domain and tags e.g. convex etc.
